 - DNS - Route 53
 - HTTPS
 - Virtual Private Cloud and Security
 - Logging
 - Monitoring
 - Cloud Formation
 - CI/CD (also local dev build with code formater and tests.)



Everything is incremental. As I learn more AWS, I can keep expanding this project slowly. This project can serve as reference for me ;).
